# Remote Configuration

Loading and managing configuration from remote sources including URLs, APIs, and cloud services.

## Overview

Remote configuration enables dynamic application configuration from external sources. This section covers:

- **[HTTP Loading](remote-http.md)** - Load configuration from HTTP endpoints with authentication
- **[Cloud Services](remote-cloud.md)** - Integration with AWS, Consul, and other cloud services  
- **[Polling & Updates](remote-polling.md)** - Automatic configuration updates and change detection
- **[Resilience Patterns](remote-resilience.md)** - Circuit breakers, fallbacks, and caching strategies

## Key Benefits

### Dynamic Configuration
- Update application behavior without redeployment
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Real-time feature flag and settings updates

### Centralized Management
- Single source of truth for configuration across services
- Consistent configuration across environments
- Audit trails and version control for configuration changes

### High Availability
- Fallback mechanisms for configuration unavailability
- Caching strategies to reduce remote dependencies
- Circuit breaker patterns for resilience
