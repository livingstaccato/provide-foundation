# Fix macOS File Descriptor Limits for pytest-xdist
#
# This script increases the macOS file descriptor limit to prevent
# Terminal.app from freezing when running pytest with many workers.
#
# Issue: pytest-xdist with 24 workers needs ~360 file descriptors,
# but macOS defaults to 256, causing system-wide terminal freezing.
