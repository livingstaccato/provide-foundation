## Running Examples

Navigate to any directory and run the examples:

```bash
# Core telemetry features
cd telemetry
python 01_basic_logging.py

# Configuration management
cd configuration  
python 01_custom_config.py

# HTTP client usage
cd transport
python 01_http_client.py

# CLI development
cd cli
python 01_cli_application.py
```

## Example Categories

### Getting Started
Start with `telemetry/01_basic_logging.py` for the simplest introduction, then explore `telemetry/02_structured_logging.py` for a complete setup.

### Configuration
Learn how to configure Foundation through code (`configuration/01_custom_config.py`) or environment variables (`configuration/02_env_variables.py`).

### Production Use
See `production/01_production_patterns.py` for patterns suitable for production deployments with structured JSON logging and health metrics.

### Advanced Features
Explore tracing, transport clients, and integrations for building robust distributed systems.

## Common Patterns

All examples demonstrate these Foundation patterns:

- **Structured Logging**: Key-value logging with contextual information
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration without hardcoded defaults
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging with tracebacks
- **Performance**: Efficient logging suitable for high-throughput applications
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics and tracing capabilities

## Notes

- All examples use Foundation's native console utilities (`pout`, `perr`) instead of `print()`
- Examples demonstrate proper dogfooding by using only Foundation's own tools and dependencies
- No external network calls - transport examples use Foundation's mocking utilities
