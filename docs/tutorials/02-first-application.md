# Tutorial: Your First Application

In this tutorial, we'll build a simple but complete task manager CLI. This will demonstrate how `provide.foundation`'s logging, CLI framework, and console output utilities work together.

## What We'll Build

A CLI tool to add, complete, and list tasks, showcasing:
- Structured logging for every action.
- Declarative CLI commands with arguments.
- Clean separation of logs from user-facing output.

## 1. Project Setup

Create a new project directory and install the framework.

```bash
mkdir task-manager
cd task-manager
pip install "provide-foundation[all]"
```

## 2. Create the Application

Create a file named `task_manager.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# task_manager.py
import sys
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Dict

from provide.foundation import logger, pout, perr, setup_telemetry
from provide.foundation.hub import Hub, register_command

# --- Data Model ---
@dataclass
class Task:
    """A simple task model."""
    id: int
    title: str
    completed: bool = False
    created_at: datetime = field(default_factory=datetime.now)

# --- In-Memory "Database" ---
# In a real app, this would be a database class.
TASKS: Dict[int, Task] = {}
NEXT_ID = 1

# --- CLI Commands ---
@register_command("add")
def add_task(title: str):
    """Add a new task."""
    global NEXT_ID
    task = Task(id=NEXT_ID, title=title)
    TASKS[task.id] = task
    logger.info("task_created", task_id=task.id, title=task.title, emoji="‚úÖ")
    pout(f"Successfully added task {task.id}: '{task.title}'", color="green")
    NEXT_ID += 1

@register_command("complete")
def complete_task(task_id: int):
    """Mark a task as completed."""
    if task_id not in TASKS:
        logger.warning("task_not_found", task_id=task_id, emoji="‚ùì")
        perr(f"Error: Task with ID {task_id} not found.", color="red")
        sys.exit(1) # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate failure

    TASKS[task_id].completed = True
    logger.info("task_completed", task_id=task_id, emoji="üéâ")
    pout(f"Task {task_id} marked as complete.", color="cyan")

@register_command("list")
def list_tasks(all: bool = False):
    """List tasks. Use --all to include completed tasks."""
    logger.debug("listing_tasks", show_all=all)
    tasks_to_show = TASKS.values()
    if not all:
        tasks_to_show = [t for t in tasks_to_show if not t.completed]

    if not tasks_to_show:
        pout("No tasks to show.", color="yellow")
        return

    pout("üìã Your Tasks:", bold=True)
    for task in tasks_to_show:
        status = "‚úÖ" if task.completed else "‚è≥"
        color = "green" if task.completed else "yellow"
        pout(f"  {status} [{task.id}] {task.title}", color=color)

# --- Main Entry Point ---
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # 1. Configure logging and other foundation systems
    setup_telemetry()

    # 2. Create a Hub to manage our application
    hub = Hub()

    # 3. The Hub discovers our @register_command functions and builds a CLI
    cli = hub.create_cli(name="task-manager", description="A simple task manager.")

    # 4. Run the CLI
    logger.info("cli_starting", emoji="üöÄ")
    cli()
    logger.info("cli_finished", emoji="üèÅ")
```

## 3. Run Your Application

Let's use the CLI we just built.

```bash
# Get help for the main command
$ python task_manager.py --help
Usage: task-manager [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A simple task manager.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  add       Add a new task.
  complete  Mark a task as completed.
  list      List tasks. Use --all to include completed tasks.

# Add some tasks
$ python task_manager.py add "Write documentation"
‚úÖ Successfully added task 1: 'Write documentation'

$ python task_manager.py add "Review pull request #42"
‚úÖ Successfully added task 2: 'Review pull request #42'

# List pending tasks (the default)
$ python task_manager.py list
üìã Your Tasks:
  ‚è≥ Write documentation
  ‚è≥ Review pull request #42

# Complete a task
$ python task_manager.py complete 1
Task 1 marked as complete.

# List all tasks, including completed ones
$ python task_manager.py list --all
üìã Your Tasks:
  ‚úÖ Write documentation
  ‚è≥ Review pull request #42
```

## 4. What You've Learned

This simple application demonstrates several core `provide.foundation` concepts:

-   **Declarative CLI:** You defined your CLI by simply writing Python functions and decorating them with `@register_command`. The framework handled argument parsing, help text generation, and command dispatch.
-   **Structured Logging:** Every significant action (`task_created`, `task_completed`) is logged with structured data (`task_id`, `title`). This is invaluable for debugging and monitoring in a real application.
-   **Separation of Concerns:**
    -   `logger` is for structured, event-based logs (for developers/systems).
    -   `pout` and `perr` are for user-facing output to `stdout` and `stderr` (for the person running the CLI).

This separation is critical. Your logs can be verbose and machine-readable (e.g., JSON) while your user output remains clean and human-friendly.
