**RFC Number**: Foundation-001
**Title**: Cross-Language Infrastructure Patterns with Shared Memory ML Integration
**Authors**: Tim Perkins
**Status**: Draft
**Type**: Architecture
**Created**: September 14, 2025
**Updated**: September 14, 2025

## Abstract

This RFC proposes a standardized approach to infrastructure patterns across multiple programming languages (Python, Go, Rust, Ruby) with specialized integration for machine learning workloads via shared memory. The core hypothesis is that semantic standardization of infrastructure patterns will enable AI-assisted development tools to reliably generate, port, and verify code across languages while maintaining idiomatic implementations within each ecosystem.

---

## I. Problem Statement & Motivation

### Current State Analysis

#### Infrastructure Development Fragmentation
Modern polyglot systems require infrastructure components across multiple languages, each implementing similar patterns differently:

- **Logging**: Python (structlog), Go (logrus/zap), Rust (log/tracing), Ruby (semantic_logger)
- **Configuration**: Python (dynaconf), Go (viper), Rust (config), Ruby (dry-configurable)
- **Retry Logic**: Python (tenacity), Go (backoff), Rust (tokio-retry), Ruby (retries)
- **HTTP Clients**: Python (httpx), Go (http), Rust (reqwest), Ruby (faraday)

#### Quantified Pain Points

**Development Overhead**:
- Average 40-60 hours per project to implement basic infrastructure
- 15-25% of development time spent on infrastructure rather than business logic
- 3-5x longer to add new language to existing polyglot project

**Maintenance Burden**:
- Different debugging approaches per language
- Inconsistent observability across components
- Duplicate effort for similar functionality

**Quality Issues**:
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Different retry/resilience behaviors
- Varied configuration management approaches

#### ML Infrastructure Specific Problems

**Current ML Development Challenges**:
- 70% of ML projects use Python for training, 40% use different languages for serving
- Average 6-month delay to productionize ML models due to infrastructure gaps
- 60% of ML infrastructure is rebuilt for each project
- Performance bottlenecks when crossing language boundaries

**Existing Solution Limitations**:
- **gRPC/REST APIs**: 5-50ms latency overhead, serialization costs
- **Embedded Python**: Memory overhead, dependency conflicts
- **Model export formats (ONNX)**: Limited model support, conversion complexity
- **Separate runtimes**: Operational complexity, resource duplication

---

## II. Core Hypothesis & Claims

### Primary Hypothesis

**Claim**: Standardized semantic patterns across languages will enable AI development tools to achieve >90% accuracy in cross-language code generation and verification.

**Prediction**: Given a Python implementation using standardized patterns, AI can generate semantically equivalent Go, Rust, and Ruby implementations that pass identical test suites.

**Falsifiable Test**:
- Implement 20 common infrastructure patterns in Python
- Use AI to generate equivalent implementations in other languages
- Measure pass rate of cross-language test suites
- **Success Criteria**: >90% test pass rate without human intervention

### Secondary Hypothesis

**Claim**: Shared memory communication can provide <1ms latency for ML inference while maintaining full language interoperability.

**Prediction**: Python ML runtime accessible via shared memory will achieve performance within 10% of direct PyTorch calls.

**Falsifiable Test**:
- Implement shared memory ML interface
- Benchmark inference latency Python→SHM→Go vs direct PyTorch
- **Success Criteria**: <1ms latency overhead, <10% throughput degradation

### Tertiary Claims

1. **Developer Productivity**: 50% reduction in infrastructure development time
2. **Code Quality**: 30% reduction in production incidents due to standardized patterns
3. **AI Training**: 10x improvement in AI code generation accuracy for infrastructure patterns

### Pattern Specification Language

#### Pattern Definition Schema
```yaml
pattern_id: "retry_with_backoff"
version: "1.0"
semantics:
  description: "Retry operation with configurable backoff strategy"
  parameters:
    max_attempts:
      type: "integer"
      range: [1, 100]
      default: 3
    base_delay:
      type: "float"
      unit: "seconds"
      range: [0.0, 300.0]
      default: 1.0
    backoff_strategy:
      type: "enum"
      values: ["linear", "exponential", "fixed"]
      default: "exponential"
    jitter:
      type: "boolean"
      default: true
  exceptions:
    retryable: ["NetworkError", "TimeoutError", "ServiceUnavailable"]
    non_retryable: ["AuthenticationError", "ValidationError"]
  guarantees:
    - "Total attempts = max_attempts"
    - "Delay between attempts follows backoff_strategy"
    - "Operation stops on non_retryable exception"
    - "Operation succeeds if any attempt succeeds"

language_mappings:
  python:
    decorator: "@retry(max_attempts={max_attempts}, base_delay={base_delay})"
    import: "from provide.foundation import retry"
    test_framework: "pytest"

  go:
    annotation: "// @retry(maxAttempts={max_attempts}, baseDelay={base_delay})"
    import: "import \"foundation/resilience\""
    test_framework: "testing"

  rust:
    macro: "#[retry(max_attempts = {max_attempts}, base_delay = {base_delay})]"
    import: "use foundation::resilience::retry"
    test_framework: "cargo test"

  ruby:
    method: "retry(max_attempts: {max_attempts}, base_delay: {base_delay})"
    import: "require 'foundation/resilience'"
    test_framework: "rspec"
```

#### Cross-Language Mapping System

**Semantic Equivalence Rules**:
1. **Parameter Mapping**: Direct semantic correspondence with type conversion
2. **Error Handling**: Exception type mapping with equivalent behavior
3. **Timing Guarantees**: Identical backoff calculations across languages
4. **State Management**: Equivalent internal state handling

**Type System Mapping**:
```yaml
type_mappings:
  integer:
    python: "int"
    go: "int"
    rust: "i32"
    ruby: "Integer"

  float:
    python: "float"
    go: "float64"
    rust: "f64"
    ruby: "Float"

  duration:
    python: "datetime.timedelta"
    go: "time.Duration"
    rust: "std::time::Duration"
    ruby: "Time"

  exception:
    python: "Exception"
    go: "error"
    rust: "Result<T, E>"
    ruby: "StandardError"
```

### Shared Memory Protocol Specification

#### Architecture Overview
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Python        │    │  Shared Memory   │    │   Go/Rust/Ruby │
│   Foundation +  │◄──►│   Protocol       │◄──►│   Foundation    │
│   PyTorch       │    │                  │    │   Clients       │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

#### Protocol Specification

**Memory Layout**:
```c
struct SHMHeader {
    uint32_t magic;           // 0xF0C01234
    uint32_t version;         // Protocol version
    uint64_t request_id;      // Unique request identifier
    uint32_t payload_size;    // Size of following payload
    uint32_t checksum;        // CRC32 of payload
};

struct InferenceRequest {
    SHMHeader header;
    char model_id[64];        // Null-terminated model identifier
    uint32_t input_count;     // Number of input tensors
    TensorDescriptor inputs[]; // Variable length tensor array
};

struct TensorDescriptor {
    uint32_t dtype;           // Data type (float32, int64, etc.)
    uint32_t ndim;           // Number of dimensions
    uint64_t shape[8];       // Dimension sizes (max 8D)
    uint64_t data_offset;    // Offset to actual data in shared memory
    uint64_t data_size;      // Size of data in bytes
};
```

**Communication Flow**:
1. **Client Request**: Write request to shared memory region
2. **Python Processing**: ML runtime processes request using PyTorch
3. **Response**: Write result back to shared memory
4. **Client Retrieval**: Client reads response and deserializes

**Performance Requirements**:
- **Latency**: <1ms for requests up to 1MB
- **Throughput**: >10,000 requests/second
- **Memory Efficiency**: <10% overhead vs direct calls
- **Concurrent Access**: Support for multiple client languages simultaneously

### Verification Framework

  - name: "basic_retry_success"
    given:
      max_attempts: 3
      base_delay: 0.1
      mock_failures: 2  # Fail first 2 attempts
    expect:
      total_attempts: 3
      success: true
      min_duration: 0.3  # 0.1 + 0.2 (exponential backoff)

      exception_type: "AuthenticationError"
    expect:
      total_attempts: 1
      success: false
      final_exception: "AuthenticationError"
```

    def run_test_suite(self, pattern_id: str, languages: list[str]) -> TestResults:
        results = {}

        for language in languages:
            # Generate test code for each language
            test_code = self.generate_test_code(pattern_id, language)

            # Execute tests in language-specific environment
            result = self.execute_tests(test_code, language)

            results[language] = result

        # Verify cross-language consistency

## IV. Implementation Design

### Phase 1: Pattern Standardization (Months 1-6)

#### Core Pattern Library
**Priority 1 Patterns** (Must implement first):
1. **Structured Logging** - Contextual, level-based logging with formatting
2. **Configuration Management** - Layered config with environment variables
3. **Retry with Backoff** - Configurable retry logic with timing guarantees
4. **Circuit Breaker** - Failure detection with automatic recovery
5. **Error Boundaries** - Consistent error handling and propagation

**Priority 2 Patterns** (Second wave):
6. **HTTP Client** - Request/response with timeout and retry
7. **CLI Framework** - Command parsing with help generation
8. **Process Execution** - Subprocess management with streaming
9. **File Operations** - Atomic writes with backup/recovery
10. **Rate Limiting** - Token bucket and sliding window algorithms

#### API Specification Example
```python
# Python Reference Implementation
@dataclass
class RetryPolicy:
    max_attempts: int = 3
    base_delay: float = 1.0
    backoff: BackoffStrategy = BackoffStrategy.EXPONENTIAL
    jitter: bool = True
    retryable_exceptions: tuple[type[Exception], ...] = (Exception,)

@retry(policy=RetryPolicy(max_attempts=5))
def unreliable_operation() -> str:
    # Implementation that may fail
    pass
```

```go
// Go Equivalent Implementation
type RetryPolicy struct {
    MaxAttempts int
    BaseDelay   time.Duration
    Backoff     BackoffStrategy
    Jitter      bool
    RetryableExceptions []error
}

// @retry(policy=RetryPolicy{MaxAttempts: 5})
func UnreliableOperation() (string, error) {
    // Implementation that may fail
}
```

    def register_model(self, model_id: str, model: torch.nn.Module):
        """Register PyTorch model for SHM access"""
        self.models[model_id] = model

    def start_shm_server(self, shm_region: str):
        """Start shared memory server for cross-language access"""
        self.shm_server.start(shm_region, self.process_inference)

    def process_inference(self, request: InferenceRequest) -> InferenceResponse:
        """Process ML inference request via shared memory"""
        model = self.models[request.model_id]
        with torch.no_grad():
            outputs = model(request.inputs)
        return InferenceResponse(outputs=outputs)
```

#### Cross-Language ML Clients
```go
// Go ML Client
type MLClient struct {
    shmConnection *SHMConnection
}

func (c *MLClient) Inference(modelID string, inputs []float64) (*InferenceResult, error) {
    request := &InferenceRequest{
        ModelID: modelID,
        Inputs:  inputs,
    }

    response, err := c.shmConnection.Send(request)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("inference failed: %w", err)
    }

                              target_language: str) -> GeneratedCode:
        """Generate equivalent code in target language"""

        # Parse source code to extract pattern usage
        patterns = self.extract_patterns(source_code, source_language)

        # Generate target language code using AI
        target_code = self.ai_model.generate(patterns, target_language)

        # Validate against pattern specifications
        validation_result = self.validate_generated_code(target_code, target_language)

        return GeneratedCode(
            code=target_code,
            validation=validation_result,
            confidence=self.calculate_confidence(patterns, target_language)
        )
```

#### Validation Tools

    def validate_equivalence(self,
                           implementations: dict[str, str]) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate that implementations are semantically equivalent"""

        # Generate test cases for each language
        test_suites = self.generate_test_suites(implementations)

        # Execute tests in parallel
        results = self.execute_parallel_tests(test_suites)

        # Compare results for equivalence
        return self.compare_test_results(results)

### Trade-offs in Design Decisions

#### Trade-off 1: Performance vs Simplicity
**Decision**: Use shared memory for ML, standard IPC for infrastructure patterns
**Rationale**: ML workloads need ultra-low latency, infrastructure patterns can tolerate higher latency
**Alternative**: Pure network-based communication
**Cost**: Increased complexity in deployment and debugging

#### Trade-off 2: Standardization vs Language Idioms
**Decision**: Semantic equivalence with idiomatic implementations
**Rationale**: Maintains developer productivity while enabling cross-language tooling
**Alternative**: Identical APIs across languages
**Cost**: More complex AI training, potential performance compromises

#### Trade-off 3: Comprehensive vs Minimal Pattern Set
**Decision**: Start with 10 core patterns, expand based on usage
**Rationale**: Faster initial validation, reduced complexity
**Alternative**: Comprehensive pattern library from start
**Cost**: May not cover all use cases initially

## Conclusion

This RFC proposes a comprehensive approach to standardizing infrastructure patterns across programming languages, with specialized integration for machine learning workloads. The core hypothesis—that semantic standardization enables AI-assisted polyglot development—represents a significant opportunity to accelerate software development while improving quality and consistency.

The proposed implementation combines proven technologies (shared memory, pattern specification) with emerging capabilities (AI-assisted development) to create a platform that addresses real pain points in modern software development. While ambitious in scope, the phased approach and rigorous validation methodology provide a path to demonstrable value throughout the development process.

Success would represent a paradigm shift in how polyglot systems are developed, potentially reducing development time by orders of magnitude while improving reliability and maintainability. The approach is designed to be testable, measurable, and adaptable based on empirical results rather than theoretical assumptions.

The next step is to initiate Phase 1 development with a focus on proving the core technical hypotheses through prototyping and early validation experiments.
