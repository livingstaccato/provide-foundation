- Zero configuration - works out of the box
- Structured event logging with key-value pairs
- Performance optimized (>14,000 msg/sec)
- Emoji-enhanced visual parsing for quick scanning
- Domain-Action-Status pattern support
- Automatic exception logging with tracebacks

### Metrics
Lightweight and extensible metrics collection with optional OpenTelemetry integration.

**Key Features:**
- Simple counter, gauge, and histogram metrics
- OpenTelemetry integration for distributed systems
- Low overhead design
- Automatic service identification

### CLI Framework
Build command-line interfaces with automatic help generation and component registration (requires `[cli]` extra).

**Key Features:**
- Declarative command registration with `@register_command`
- Automatic help text generation
- Built on Click for robust argument parsing
- Component-based architecture with the Hub system
- Rich console output with colors and formatting

### Configuration Management
Flexible configuration system supporting environment variables, files, and runtime updates.

**Key Features:**
- Environment variable support with type coercion
- File-based configuration (YAML, JSON, TOML)
- Secret file support with `file://` prefix
- Type-safe configuration classes with attrs
- Runtime configuration updates

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling with retry logic and error boundaries.

**Key Features:**
- Rich error types for different failure modes
- Automatic error logging with context
- Integration with structured logging
- Clear error messages for debugging

### Resilience Patterns
Suite of decorators for building reliable applications (retry, circuit breaker, bulkhead).

**Key Features:**
- `@retry` decorator with exponential backoff
- Configurable retry strategies
- Exception filtering
- Automatic logging of retry attempts

- Support for common Python types (datetime, Path, etc.)
- Pretty printing support
- Consistent formatting

### Console I/O
Enhanced console input/output with color support, JSON mode, and interactive prompts.

**Key Features:**
- Color-coded output with `pout()` and `perr()`
- Interactive prompts with validation
- JSON mode for machine-readable output
- Progress indicators

### Hub and Registry
Central system for managing application components, commands, and resources.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-dimensional component registry
- Automatic command discovery
- Dependency injection patterns
- Component lifecycle management
- Context propagation

## Additional Utilities

### Formatting Utilities
Collection of helpers for formatting text, numbers, and data structures.
