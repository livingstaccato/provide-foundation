## Configuring the Logger

`provide.foundation` is designed to work beautifully out of the box, but it also offers a powerful and flexible configuration system for when you need more control. You can configure the logger using environment variables or directly in your code.

### Zero-Configuration Default

If you provide no configuration, the logger will run with a sensible set of defaults:

*   **Log Level**: `DEBUG`
*   **Formatter**: `key_value` (human-readable console format)
*   **Emoji Prefixes**: All emoji systems (logger name and semantic) are enabled.
*   **Semantic Layers**: No layers are enabled by default; the system relies on the [DAS fallback](./semantic-layers.md#the-domain-action-status-das-fallback).

This setup is perfect for local development and debugging.

### Method 1: Configuration via Environment Variables

For production environments, and for making quick changes without altering code, environment variables are the recommended method of configuration.

Here is a complete list of the available environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FOUNDATION_SERVICE_NAME` | A name for your service, included in all log entries. | `None` | `my-api-service` |
| `FOUNDATION_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` | Set to `true` to disable all logging output globally. | `false` | `true` |
| `FOUNDATION_LOG_LEVEL` | The default log level for all loggers. | `DEBUG` | `INFO` |
| `FOUNDATION_LOG_MODULE_LEVELS` | A comma-separated list of `module:level` pairs for fine-grained control. | `""` | `noisy_lib:WARNING,auth_service:DEBUG` |
| `FOUNDATION_LOG_CONSOLE_FORMATTER` | The output format for the console. | `key_value` | `json` |
| `FOUNDATION_LOG_LOGGER_NAME_EMOJI_ENABLED` | Set to `false` to disable the logger-name-based emoji prefix. | `true` | `false` |
| `FOUNDATION_LOG_DAS_EMOJI_ENABLED` | Set to `false` to disable the semantic (DAS or Layer-based) emoji prefix. | `true` | `false` |
| `FOUNDATION_LOG_OMIT_TIMESTAMP` | Set to `true` to remove the timestamp from the output. | `false` | `true` |
| `FOUNDATION_LOG_ENABLED_SEMANTIC_LAYERS` | A comma-separated list of built-in semantic layers to activate. | `""` | `http,database,llm` |
| `FOUNDATION_SHOW_EMOJI_MATRIX` | Set to `true` to print a reference of all active emoji mappings on startup. | `false` | `true` |

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Set environment variables before running your app
export FOUNDATION_LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
export FOUNDATION_LOG_CONSOLE_FORMATTER="json"
export FOUNDATION_SERVICE_NAME="billing-service"

python your_app.py
```

### Method 2: Programmatic Configuration

For the most control and for complex or dynamic configurations, you can configure the logger directly in your code using the available data classes. This should be done once, at the very beginning of your application's lifecycle.

This method uses two main data classes:

*   `TelemetryConfig`: The top-level configuration object.
*   `LoggingConfig`: A nested object specifically for logging-related settings.

**Example:**

```python
# In your application's main entry point (e.g., main.py or app.py)

from provide.foundation import (
    setup_telemetry,
    TelemetryConfig,
    LoggingConfig,
    SemanticLayer, # For custom layers
)

# 1. Create a LoggingConfig instance
logging_config = LoggingConfig(
    default_level="INFO",
    console_formatter="json",
    
    # Set per-module log levels for fine-grained control
    module_levels={
        "noisy_library.utils": "WARNING",
        "critical_component.io": "DEBUG",
    },
    
    # Enable built-in semantic layers
    enabled_semantic_layers=["http", "database"],
    
    # You can also define and add custom semantic layers directly
    # custom_semantic_layers=[...]
)

# 2. Create the main TelemetryConfig instance
telemetry_config = TelemetryConfig(
    service_name="my-awesome-app",
    logging=logging_config,
)

# 3. Apply the configuration
# This should be called before any logging occurs
setup_telemetry(telemetry_config)


# Now, you can import and use the logger anywhere else in your app
# It will automatically use the configuration you just set up
from provide.foundation import logger

logger.info("This log will be formatted as JSON and will only appear if its level is INFO or higher.")
```

### Configuration Precedence

If both programmatic and environment variable configurations are present, the behavior is as follows:

1.  **`setup_telemetry(config)` is called**: The programmatic configuration provided in the `config` object takes precedence and is used exclusively.
2.  **`setup_telemetry()` is called with no arguments**: The system will attempt to load configuration from environment variables.
3.  **No setup is called (lazy initialization)**: The first time `logger` is used, it will initialize itself by loading configuration from environment variables.

For predictable behavior, it is best to choose one method and use it consistently, with the recommended approach being a single, explicit `setup_telemetry()` call at application startup.
