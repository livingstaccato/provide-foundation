## What is Structured Logging?

Structured logging is the practice of creating log messages with a consistent, machine-readable format, typically by treating log events as collections of key-value pairs rather than as simple strings.

`provide.foundation` is built entirely around this principle.

### The Unstructured Approach

Traditionally, developers have written logs by embedding variables directly into a string.

!!! danger "Anti-Pattern: Unstructured Logging"
    ```python
    user_id = "usr_123"
    ip = "192.168.1.101"
    order_id = "ord_abc"

    print(f"User {user_id} from IP {ip} completed checkout for order {order_id}.")
    # Output: User usr_123 from IP 192.168.1.101 completed checkout for order ord_abc.
    ```

    While this is easy for a human to read, it presents several problems:

    *   **Difficult to Parse**: To find all checkouts for a specific user, you would need to use complex and brittle regular expressions.
    *   **Inconsistent**: Another developer might log the same event with a slightly different message, making it impossible to reliably query for these events.
    *   **Loss of Data Types**: All data is flattened into a string. The number `123` becomes indistinguishable from the string `"123"`.

### The Structured Approach

With structured logging, you separate the descriptive message from the contextual data.

!!! success "Best Practice: Structured Logging"
    ```python
    from provide.foundation import logger

    user_id = "usr_123"
    ip = "192.168.1.101"
    order_id = "ord_abc"

    logger.info(
        "Checkout complete",
        user_id=user_id,
        ip_address=ip,
        order_id=order_id,
    )
    ```

    This approach has significant advantages:

    *   **Easily Searchable**: You can easily query your logs for specific key-value pairs, such as `user_id="usr_123"`.
    *   **Consistent and Reliable**: The event is always represented with the same set of keys, making analytics and alerting straightforward.
    *   **Preserves Data Types**: When used with a JSON formatter, the original data types are preserved.
    *   **Clear Separation**: The constant `event` message is distinct from the variable `context`.

### How `provide.foundation` Implements It

`provide.foundation` makes structured logging the default and only way to log. When you call a logging method:

*   The first argument is the `event` message.
*   All subsequent keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) become the structured `context`.

```python
logger.info("This is the event", this_is="the context", and_so="is this")
```

By embracing this pattern, `provide.foundation` ensures that your logs are not just useful for immediate debugging, but are also a valuable, long-term asset for understanding and monitoring your application's behavior.
