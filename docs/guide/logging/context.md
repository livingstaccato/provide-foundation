# Context Management

Managing context in logging for correlation and debugging across application components.

## Overview

Context management is crucial for understanding log relationships in complex applications. This section covers:

- **Basic Context** - Simple context binding and usage
- **Threading Context** - Managing context across threads  
- **Advanced Patterns** - Global context and propagation
- **Implementation Patterns** - Real-world context usage patterns

## Context Management Topics

### [Basic Context Binding](context-basics.md)

Fundamental context operations:
- Logger binding and context creation
- Request-scoped context
- Basic context patterns
- Context clearing and cleanup

### [Threading and Concurrency](context-threading.md)

Managing context in concurrent environments:
- Thread-local context storage
- Context inheritance across threads
- Async context management
- Process context isolation

### [Advanced Context Patterns](context-advanced.md)

Sophisticated context management:
- Global context configuration
- Context propagation strategies  
- Distributed context correlation
- Context serialization and storage

### [Implementation Patterns](context-patterns.md)

Practical context usage patterns:
- Dynamic context modification
- Middleware integration patterns
- Testing with context
- Performance considerations
- Best practices and guidelines
