# Performance Tuning

Advanced performance tuning techniques for high-throughput logging scenarios.

## Overview

This section covers performance optimization strategies for provide.foundation logging:

- **[Benchmarks](benchmarks.md)**: Performance benchmarks and testing
- **[Optimization Techniques](optimization.md)**: Configuration and code patterns for maximum performance  
- **[Sampling Strategies](sampling.md)**: Log sampling and rate limiting techniques

Each subsection provides detailed guidance for optimizing logging performance in production environments.
