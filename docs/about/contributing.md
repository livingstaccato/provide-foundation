## Contributing to provide.foundation

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing a bug, proposing a new feature, or improving the documentation, your help is greatly appreciated.

### Where to Start

*   **Bug Reports**: If you've found a bug, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/provide-io/provide-foundation/issues). Include as much detail as possible, such as your operating system, Python version, library version, and a minimal reproducible example.
*   **Feature Requests**: For new features, we also recommend opening an issue to discuss the proposal first. This allows the maintainers and the community to provide feedback before you spend time on an implementation.
*   **Code Contributions**: If you'd like to contribute code, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Ensure that your code adheres to the project's style and conventions.

### Development Environment

For detailed instructions on how to set up your development environment, including virtual environment and dependency management, please consult the following documents in the root of the repository:

*   **DEVELOPMENT.md**: The primary guide for setting up your local environment, running tests, and using the development scripts.
*   **CLAUDE.md**: A specialized guide (originally for the Claude AI assistant, but useful for humans too!) that provides deep insights into the project's architecture, coding conventions, and key design patterns.

### Code Style and Quality

`provide.foundation` uses a strict set of tools to maintain code quality and consistency:

*   **Linting**: `ruff check .`
*   **Formatting**: `ruff format .`
*   **Type Checking**: `mypy src/`

Please ensure you run these tools on your code before submitting a pull request. Our continuous integration (CI) pipeline will also run these checks.

Thank you for helping make `provide.foundation` better!
